## Log Equations

$$Log_{x} = Log_{10}(x)$$

$$[Log(2x) = 3] == [2x = 10^{3}]$$

$$Log_{2}(x) = \frac{log_{10}(x)}{log_{10}(2)} = \frac{log(x)}{log(2)}$$

## Chapter 1

### Nyquist Theorem

- M : Max Bitrate
- f : Max Frequency
- B : number of different components

$$M = 2f * log_{2}B$$

### Shannon's (Noisy) Theorem

- S/N : Signal-to-noise ratio
$$Bitrate = Bandwidth * log_{2}(1+\frac{S}{N})$$

### Decibel Conversion
- Convertt between S/N and dB

$$dB=10*log_{10}(\frac{S}{N})$$
$$\frac{S}{N}=10^{\frac{dB}{10}}$$

## Chapter 2

### Refraction Index

- alpha : angle at which light wave intersects the boundary
- beta : angle at which light wave travels from the boundary
- if index of refraction is less that 1 (alpha>beta) and less than a critical angle, no refracted light. All light is reflected

$$Refraction Index = \frac{cos\alpha}{cos\beta}$$
